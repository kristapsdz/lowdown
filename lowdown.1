.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility translates from markdown into HTML5 in XML mode (the default) or
roff using the
.Fl ms
or
.Fl man
macro packages.
If not given a
.Ar file ,
or if
.Ar file
is
.Dq - ,
.Nm
reads from standard input.
The results are written to standard output.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar feature
Disable the given
.Ar feature
.Pq see Sx Output features .
See
.Fl E .
You can specify this multiple times for different features.
.It Fl d Ar feature
Disable the given
.Ar feature
.Pq see Sx Input features .
See
.Fl e .
You can specify this multiple times for different features.
.It Fl E Ar feature
Enable the given
.Ar feature
.Pq see Sx Output features .
See
.Fl D .
You can specify this multiple times for different features.
.It Fl e Ar feature
Enable the given
.Ar feature
.Pq see Sx Input features .
See
.Fl d .
You can specify this multiple times for different features.
.It Fl o Ar file
Send output to
.Ar file
unless it's
.Dq - ,
in which case fall back to the default of standard output.
.It Fl s
Standalone mode.
This emits a minimal HTML5 or roff document surrounding the output.
You will probably need to hand-edit it.
If you have the
.Ar metadata
feature enabled (the default), the title for the document is pulled from
the metadata key
.Dq title
and the date from the
.Dq rcsdate
.Pq in RCS $Date$ format, see Xr rcs 1
or
.Dq date
.Pq ISO-8601 YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD
metadata keys.
Else these are set to
.Dq Untitled article
and the current date.
.It Fl T Ar mode
The output mode.
This may be
.Ar html
for HTML5 output,
.Ar ms
for roff output using the classic (i.e., no-extension)
.Fl ms
package and needing table support, or
.Ar man
for roff ouput using the classic
.Fl man
package.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Prints out warnings regarding Markdown syntax conformity.
.It Fl X Ar keyword
Instead of converting the file, extract the given metadata keyword and
exit.
Only the
.Fl v
and
.Fl o
flags are recognised.
.El
.Pp
For best results, use the
.Fl T Ar html
output, as it includes graphics and equations.
The
.Ar ms
and
.Ar man
modes will elide graphics and equations.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
enables the
.Ar autolink ,
.Ar fenced ,
.Ar footnotes ,
.Ar metadata ,
.Ar strike ,
.Ar super ,
and
.Ar tables
features.
You can see a full list of features in
.Sx Input features .
The
.Ar html-skiphtml ,
.Ar nroff-groff
and
.Ar nroff-skiphtml
output features are enabled by default.
See
.Sx Output features
for a full list.
.Ss Input features
There are a number of Markdown (and Markdown extension) features supported by
.Nm .
These can be enabled with
.Fl e
and disabled with
.Fl d .
They are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar autolink
Autolink
.Li http ,
.Li https ,
.Li ftp ,
.Li mailto ,
and relative links or link fragments.
.It Ar fenced
Allow for GFM fenced (language-specific) code blocks.
.It Ar footnotes
MMD style footnotes.
This only supports one-liner footnotes on the same line as the footnote
definition (not the in-line referent).
.It Ar hilite
Highlight.
Do not use this option.
.It Ar math
Recognise single-dollar math mode.
.It Ar mathexp
Recognise double-dollar math mode.
This only works if
.Ar math
has also been enabled.
.It Ar metadata
Accept MMD metadata.
For the first paragraph to count as meta-data, the first line must have
a colon in it.
Otherwise it's considered a regular paragraph.
.It Ar nocodeind
Do not indent code blocks.
.It Ar nointem
Disable emphasis with links.
.It Ar sphd
Require a space between hash marks and header.
.It Ar strike
Strikethrough support.
.It Ar super
Allow for super-scripts.
This accepts foo^bar, which puts the parts following the caret until
whitespace in superscripts; or foo^(bar), which puts only the parts in
parenthesis.
.It Ar tables
Allow for GFM tables.
.El
.Pp
The parser also accepts link titles (quoted alongside the link address)
and image dimensions (=WxH or =Wx).
Both may also be specified, in any order.
For example,
.Li ![alt](url "title" =23x24) .
These are fairly standard Markdown extensions.
.Ss Output features
.Nm
allows for limited control over output features.
These can be enabled with
.Fl E
and disabled with
.Fl D .
They are as follows, prefixed by
.Dq html
or
.Dq nroff
depending upon the output mode:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar html-escape
Leaves in-line HTML in its source form as if it were opaque text.
.It Ar html-hardwrap
Retain line-breaks within paragraphs.
.It Ar html-skiphtml
Do not render in-document HTML at all.
Note that
.Ar html-escape
takes priority if both are specified.
Text within HTML elements remains.
.It Ar nroff-groff
Use GNU extensions (i.e., for
.Xr groff 1 )
when rendering output.
You'll need to include
.Fl m Ar pdfmark
when invoking
.Xr groff 1
for formatting links.
.It Ar nroff-hardwrap
Retain line-breaks within paragraphs.
.It Ar nroff-skiphtml
Do not render in-document HTML at all.
Text within HTML elements remains.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
To emit a standalone HTML5 document from a file
.Pa foo.md :
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s foo.md > foo.html
.Pp
To do the same but using
.Xr groff 1
to format as a PS file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -s -Tms foo.md | \e
  groff -t -ms -mpdfmark > foo.ps
.Ed
.Pp
Note the
.Fl t :
since
.Nm
may emit tables, you'll need it.
Moreover, the
.Fl m Ar pdfmark
is for the groff extensions.
Alternatively, using only
.Xr mandoc 1 :
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -sT man foo.md | mandoc -Tps > foo.ps
.Pp
If your document uses UTF-8 without the byte-order mark, you may need to
specifically set the encoding in either formatter:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -sT man foo.md | mandoc -Tps -Kutf-8 > foo.ps
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -sT ms foo.md | \e
  groff -k -Dutf8 -t -ms -mpdfmark > foo.ps
.Ed
.Pp
To extract the title from a file's metadata:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -X title foo.md
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Pp
If the
.Fl X
flag is used,
.Nm
exits with an error if the given keyword is not found.
.Sh STANDARDS
.Nm
implements the classic Markdown specification along with some
extensions.
See
.Sx Input features
and
.Sx Output features
for a list.
