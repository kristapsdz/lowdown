.Sh NAME
.Nm lowdown_tree_rndr
.Nd render Markdown into debugging output
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb liblowdown
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/queue.h
.In stdio.h
.In lowdown.h
.Ft int
.Fo lowdown_tree_rndr
.Fa "struct lowdown_buf *out"
.Fa "const struct lowdown_node *n"
.Fa "const struct lowdown_opts *opts"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Renders a node tree
.Fa n
created by
.Xr lowdown_doc_parse 3
or
.Xr lowdown_diff 3 .
The output is written into
.Fa out ,
which must be initialised and freed by the caller.
.Pp
The output consists of an UTF-8 tree.
The format is not standardised and subject to change.
.Pp
Unlike other renderers,
.Fn lowdown_tree_rndr
accepts no options and thus has no context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns zero on failure to allocate memory, non-zero on success.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following parses
.Va b
of length
.Va bsz
and outputs the parse tree.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct lowdown_buf *out;
struct lowdown_doc *doc;
struct lowdown_node *n;
void *rndr;

if ((doc = lowdown_doc_new(NULL)) == NULL)

	err(1, NULL);
if ((out = lowdown_buf_new(256)) == NULL)
	err(1, NULL);
if (!lowdown_tree_rndr(out, n))
	err(1, NULL);

fwrite(out->data, 1, out->size, stdout);
