.Sh DESCRIPTION
Markdown is a simple, plain-text formatting language.
.Dq Plain-text
in this case means the document input looks similar to the output, less
the formatting niceties (boxed tables, italics, clickable links, etc.)
provided by the output medium.

# How to be a Picard fan

## Introduction

In order to develop fandom skills one must first and foremost
know *whom* one idolises. Therefore: **who is Captain Picard**?

1. Picard was named the \e*Best Star Trek Captain\e*, according
to a [5-week poll](poll.html).

    > Picard continued his winning ways in the final week,
    > with fans naming him the most inspiring captain.

2. Picard is handsome. ![Picard](image.jpg)
3. Picard knows how to code: `make engage`

---------------------------------

## Picard Fandom

Here's why everyone wants to be a fan...
.Ed
.Pp
This example consists of a series of block elements: section header,
sub-section header, paragraph, set of list elements, horizontal rule,
then another sub-section header.
Each block element contains inline elements: normal text, emphasised text
(bold and italised), an image, a link, and a span of code.
.Pp
This document describes the Markdown syntax accepted by
.Xr lowdown 1 .
.
.
.Sh TEXT
Text within Markdown documents must be UTF-8.
The document may have the byte-order mark (BOM), although this practice
is discouraged by the Unicode standard.
Lines of text may be UNIX terminated
.Pq Sq \en
or DOS
.Pq Sq \er\en .
In the latter case, carriage returns are stripped from input if detected
at the first line.
.
.
.Sh BLOCK ELEMENTS
A block element starts on a new line and extends to the next blank line
or block element.
A block element contains inline elements.
.
.Ss Paragraphs and Line Breaks
A paragraph is made up of one or more lines of text possibly containing
inline elements.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.
.Pp
To insert a hard line break (i.e., a line-break in the input that is
reproduced in the output), insert two spaces at the end of the line.
If commonmark input parsing is enabled, this may also be effected by
escaping the newline:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Darmok and Jalad...\e
at Tanagra.
.Ed
.
.Ss Headers
There are two styles of headers: underlined
.Pq Dq setext
and hash-marked
.Pq Dq atx .
For underlined headers, underline the given word using equal signs
.Pq Dq =
for first-level headers and dashes
.Pq Dq \&-
for second-level headers.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
This is an underlined header 1
==============================
.Ed
.Pp
For hash-marked headers, use the corresponding number of hash characters
to the corresponding level of header, up to 6 levels, at the start of
the line separated by one space followed by the header.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
## This is a hash-marked header 2
.Ed
.Pp
If commonmark input parsing is enabled, the space is required after the
hash-marks in any hash-marked header.
.Pp
Both types support PHP Extra attributes enclosed in curly braces.
These may begin at any point and must end at the end of the line.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
## Star Trek: Enterprise { #stent }

Star Trek: Enterprise { .reboots }
---------------------
.Ed
.Pp
Non-empty values with a leading period are interpreted as HTML (CSS) or
OpenDocument classes, and values with a leading pound symbol are
interpreted as in-document link identifiers.
.Pp
Extra attribute identifiers override the default mechanism for creating
header identifiers.
They should contain only ASCII alphanumeric characters.
.Ss Block Quotes
Block quoted sections are invoked with a single right-angle bracket
.Pq Dq >
followed by a space at the start of each line and between paragraphs.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
> The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules;
> it is a philosophy... and a very correct one.
>
> (It goes on for a few paragraphs).
.Ed
.Pp
Block quotes may also have a non-multiline invocation: you need only
invoke the right-angle bracket at the start of a paragraph and omit it
entirely between paragraphs.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
> You cannot explain away a wantonly immoral act because
you think it is connected to some higher purpose.

> Here is another paragraph about Picard wisdom.
.Ed
.Pp
Consecutive blockquotes as above will be merged as paragraphs within a
single block quote on output, even if styles
.Pq non-multiline and otherwise
are mixed.
.Pp
Block quotes may be nested within other block quotes, as may any other
block elements such as headers, ordered/unordered lists, and code
blocks.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
> ### hash-marked header 3
>
> > I'd be delighted to offer any advice
> > I have on understanding women.
> > When I have some, I'll let you know.
>
> 1.  advice list item 1
> 2.  advice list item 2
>
> Here's the code to implement JLP's advice:

>     yes | read engage
.Ed
.
.Ss Admonitions
Also called
.Qq callouts ,
these special block quotes call attention to contents.
These are generally rendered as-is, but some output modes will specially
render admonitions to highlight the content.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
> **Note**
>
> The computer is voiced by Majel Barrett.
.Ed
.Pp
Callouts begin with a double-emphasis
.Qq Note
or
.Qq Warning ,
and omitting the initial newline suppresses white-space after the
callout type.
This is GFM syntax.
The MDN syntax includes an initial phrase following the callout type and
colon, and also supports the
.Qq Callout
type:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
> **Warning:** red alert.
>
> Romulan warbird decloaking!
.Ed
.Ss Lists
Lists may be specified as ordered (numbered) or unordered.
Ordered lists are invoked as numbers followed by periods
.Pq e.g., Dq 1.
and rendered in a similar format.
.Em Note :
it does not matter which order or which numbers you use in your ordered
lists, as all ordered lists start at one.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
1. Make.
2. It.
1. So. (Not 1. again!)
.Ed
.Pp
If commonmark input parsing is enabled, list items may alternatively
terminate with the right parenthesis:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
1) Live long
2) Prosper
.Ed
.Pp
To prevent lists erroneously started by a paragraph beginning with a
number and period, use a backslash before the period.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
1987. The year TNG premiered.

1987\e. The year TNG premiered.
.Ed
.Pp
Unordered lists, on the other hand, can be invoked using either
asterisk
.Pq Dq * ,
pluses
.Pq Dq + ,
or hyphens
.Pq Dq \- ,
and can be a mix of all three styles.
Regardless the style, list items are rendered the same way.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
- Earl Grey tea.
* Shakespeare.
+ Exotic fish.
.Ed
.Pp
All nested block elements need a new line break, otherwise they will be
rendered on the same line as the list item on output.
To insert paragraphs into a list item, indent each paragraph with either
four spaces or one tab.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
- First list item

    Courage can be an emotion too.

    Things are only impossible until they're not.
+ Second list item
+ Third list item
.Ed
.Pp
To insert block quotes into a list item, indent the block quote with
four spaces or one tab prior to the right-angle bracket
.Pq Dq > .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
* List item 1
* List item 2

     > I am Locutus of Borg.

     > That is the cutest of Borg.
.Ed
.Pp
Code blocks need to be indented twice (two tabs or eight leading spaces): once
for being recognised within the list item, another for the code block itself.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
* Here is a list item for an indented code block:

        alias path='echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n}'
.Ed
.Pp
To make list elements occur in tight sequence \(em like a grocery list
\(em don't have an empty line between the items.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
- Phaser
- Communicator
.Ed
.Pp
On the other hand, if you want to render lists separated by white-space,
use the following syntax:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
- A phaser is a type of weapon.

- A communicator keeps Riker in contact with Troi.
.Ed
.Pp
This applies to ordered and unordered list types.
.
.Ss Task lists
One form of an unordered list is task lists, a GFM extension.
These begin with checkboxes (checked or not), rendered similarly in the output.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Star Trek series with episodes in the Delta quadrant:

- [ ] Original series
- [x] TNG
- [ ] DS9
- [x] Voyager
- [ ] Enterprise
- [ ] Discovery
.Ed
.Pp
The check may be upper or lower case.
A space must follow the right square bracket.
.
.Ss Definition Lists
Definition lists are a PHP Extra extension.
They're similar to lists except in having key and value pairs, with keys
being preceded by a blank line:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Best understated characters:

*Quark*
: Armin Shimerman

*Weyoun*
: Jeffrey Combs
.Ed
.Pp
Keys consist of a single line and may contain inline elements.
Like other lists, values may consist of arbitrary nested blocks.
There may be multiple consecutive values per key.
If the key and value are separated by a blank line, the list is emitted
as if it contained block elements (usually output as spacing between
key-value pairs).
.
.Ss Code Blocks
Code blocks consist of pre-formatted text, such as source code.
Each code block contains opaque/literal text.
This means that new lines and white spaces are retained \(em they're not
formatted in any way, and any text inside the code block is not
interpreted.
To invoke a code block, create a line break then indent each line with four
spaces or one tab.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Here is a paragraph about Bridge protocol

    Here is a code block for the command "Engage"
.Ed
.Pp
Within a code block, text is escaped given the output format.
Therefore, characters that would normally need to be escaped in other
text processing languages such as ampersands
.Pq Dq &
do not need to be escaped.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Here is how you start the program xterm:

    xterm &
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, code blocks are called
.Dq fenced
if they're surrounded in three or more matching backticks or tildes.
Code fences may optionally include the language used in the code fence
following the header, such as in the following.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
```c
int main(void) {
  puts("Engage!");
  return 0;
}
```
.Ed
.Pp
The language, if provided, is usually passed into the output is
auxiliary information such as an HTML class.
.
.Ss Horizontal Rules
A horizontal rule is a line that goes across an output page.
These are invoked with three or more asterisks
.Pq Dq * ,
hyphens
.Pq Dq \- ,
or underscores
.Pq Dq _
on their own line.
Spaces between these characters are disregarded.
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.
.Ss Metadata
Documents can include metadata that is not part of the main text.
The syntax follows the MMD and Pandoc specifications.
.Pp
In the MMD syntax, the block begins on the document's first line and
continues until the first blank line.
Keys and values are separated by a colon, and pairs separated by a
newline.
A key (and following value) must exist on the line beginning the
metadata pair, but the value may span multiple lines.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Title: Captain's log
Author: Captain J-L Picard
Summary: As part of an exchange program, we're taking
 aboard a Klingon officer to return the recent visit
 of Commander Riker to the cruiser Pagh.
Stardate: 43917.4
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, a block of MMD metadata may begin with a line of
.Qq ---
and end with
.Qq ---
or
.Qq \&... .
.Pp
If there are multiple lines of text in a metadata value, subsequent
lines should (but need not) be offset with whitespace.
Otherwise, they must not have a colon in the value, else they will be
construed as a subsequent pair's key.
.Pp
End each line with two spaces to ensure linebreaks are rendered on
output for non-conforming Markdown renderers.
Moreover, beginning a document with a regular sentence containing a
colon might invoke metadata.
To escape this, add one blank line to the beginning of the document.
.Pp
Metadata keys must consist of alphanumeric ASCII characters, the hyphen
.Pq Qq \&- ,
or the underscore
.Pq Qq \&_ .
They must have at least one character and are stripped of white-space,
have non-conforming characters replaced with underscores, and converted
to lower case.
.Pp
Metadata values are opaque text: Markdown statements (e.g., italics,
entities, etc.) are copied as-is.
The values will have leading white-space stripped, i.e., space following
the colon.
.Pp
If multiple metadata keys resolve to the same name, the last invocation
is retained.
This check happens after canonicalising the name by stripping spaces,
converting to lower-case, and substituting unknown characters.
.Pp
In the Pandoc syntax, the block stops at the first line not starting
with a percent sign or space.
Metadata is limited to at most three keys: title, author(s), and date.
The first line is for title, the second (if provided) for author(s), and
the third (also if provided) for date.
Lines may continue by having a subsequent line begin with a space.
If only one leading-percent line is included, the metadata is only for
the title; if two, for a title and author(s); and so on.
If a leading-percent line is blank, the corresponding metadata is left
empty (unspecified).
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% A Skin of Evil
% Tasha Yar
  Armus
% 1988-04-2525

Wow what a day...
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple authors may be separated by multiple white-space (including
newlines), a semicolon, or both.
.Pp
The Pandoc title line is automatically scanned for whether it's a
manpage-style title:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% TREK(6)
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm lowdown
recognises a manpage title from the open parenthesis followed by a
number (or
.Qq n ) ,
optional following characters, then a closing parenthesis.
If found, the title is broken down into title and section.
Any text following the title is further recognised as the source and, if
a vertical bar is detected, what comes after as the volume.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% TREK(6) OpenBSD | Games Manual
.Ed
.Pp
These may be accessed with the
.Li title
and
.Li section
metadata keys, and optionally
.Li volume
and
.Li source .
.Pp
Using either syntax, dates should be in the YYYY-MM-DD format, but can
be in any format.
Metadata values may be pasted into a document by
referencing the
.Li \&[%key] ,
such as using the above example, again with the caveat that Markdown
annotations (italics, etc.) are copied verbatim:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
date: 43917.4

It's currently stardate [%date].
.Ed
.Pp
Or using Pandoc:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%
%
% 43917.4
It's currently stardate [%date].
.Ed
.
.
.Ss Mathematics
Mathematics support is an extension of Markdown.
The extension only describes how the math blocks begin and end: the
contained equations are usually in LaTeX and implemented in the
front-end (e.g., HTML).
There are two types: inline and block.
Both may occur anywhere in a text stream.
Inline equations are rendered as part of the text; block equations are
rendered on their own.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
This is an inline $f(x)$ function.
This is a block $$f(x)$$ function.
This is also an inline \e\e(f(x)\e\e) function.
This is also a block \e\e[f(x)\e\e] function.
.Ed
.
.Ss Tables
Tables are a GFM (GitHub-flavoured Markdown) extension of the basic
syntax.
They consist of a table header and body, and columns may be left, right,
or centre justified.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
| Officer         | Rank                 |
| --------------: | -------------------- |
| Jean-Luc Picard | Captain              |
| Worf            | Lieutenant Commander |
| Data            | Lieutenant Commander |
| William Riker   | Commander            |
.Ed
.Pp
The table header must be followed by a line of hyphens with at least
three hyphen/colons per column.
Columns are separated by vertical bars.
The colon indicates alignment: a colon at the beginning means left
justified; at the right for right justified, and both for centred.
.Pp
The leading and trailing column separator is superfluous.
Table data is not necessary, but the table header is.
The minimum table structure for the above is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Officer | Rank
--:|---
Jean-Luc Picard | Captain
.Ed
.Pp
Table columns may contain arbitrary inline elements.
.
.Ss Footnote Definition
Footnotes are a MMD extension of the basic syntax.
Footnote definitions may occur anywhere in the text (except within
blocks) and are
.Dq pointed to
by a
.Sx Footnote Reference .
They consist of the footnote name (in square brackets, preceded by the
caret), a colon, then everything remaining in the block is the footnote
content.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[^pt]:
    Klingon insult, meaning something like "weirdo," deriving from
    the verb "to be weird" (**taQ**), with and [sic] you (plural)
    imperative prefix (**pe-**).
.Ed
.Pp
Footnote contents may be on the same line as the colon.
The footnote name is rendered as a number.
If a footnote definition is not referred to, it is not printed.
.
.Ss HTML Blocks
Embedded HTML is discouraged, as it inhibits formatting into non-HTML
output, but is still accepted.
Blocks of HTML must begin with a recognised HTML block-level element.
.Pp
In the original Markdown, block-level elements were well-defined by
HTML4.
HTML5 elements are also accepted, but as there is no concept of
block-level in HTML5, these are non-canonical.
Accepted elements are
.Li <address> ,
.Li <article> ,
.Li <aside> ,
.Li <blockquote> ,
.Li <del> ,
.Li <details> ,
.Li <dialog> ,
.Li <dd> ,
.Li <div> ,
.Li <dl> ,
.Li <dt> ,
.Li <fieldset> ,
.Li <figcaption> ,
.Li <figure> ,
.Li <footer> ,
.Li <form> ,
.Li <h1> ,
.Li <h2> ,
.Li <h3> ,
.Li <h4> ,
.Li <h5> ,
.Li <h6> ,
.Li <header> ,
.Li <hgroup> ,
.Li <iframe> ,
.Li <ins> ,
.Li <li> ,
.Li <main> ,
.Li <math> ,
.Li <nav> ,
.Li <noscript> ,
.Li <ol> ,
.Li <p> ,
.Li <pre> ,
.Li <section> ,
.Li <script> ,
.Li <style> ,
.Li <table> ,
.Li <ul> .
The void elements
.Li <br /> ,
.Li <hr /> ,
.Li <link /> ,
and
.Li <meta />
are also recognised, and need not be self-closed.
.Sh INLINE ELEMENTS
Elements within a block element.
Sometimes called
.Pq inline
elements.
For example, normal text, a span of emphasised text, or a hyperlink.
An inline element cannot contain a block element, but can contain other
inline elements.
.
.Ss Emphasis
There are two different styles of emphasis: strong, usually rendered as
bold; and emphasis, usually rendered as italics.
This is confusing, so sometimes the former is referred to as a
.Dq double-emphasis
while the latter is a
.Dq single-emphasis .
.Pp
Text surrounded by a single asterisk
.Pq Dq *
or underscore
.Pq Dq _ ,
the single-emphasis variant, is traditionally rendered with italics.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*Captain Picard*
_Captain Picard_
.Ed
.Pp
Text surrounded by a double asterisk
.Pq Dq **
or underscore
.Pq Dq __ ,
the double-emphasis variant, is traditionally rendered as bold.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
**Jean-Luc Picard**
__Jean-Luc Picard__
.Ed
.Pp
Emphasis may occur within the middle of a word:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
En*ter*prise
.Ed
.Pp
In order to produce a literal asterisk
.Pq Dq *
or underscore
.Pq Dq _
simply surround the character by white space.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
The ship * USS Enterprise * will not be emphasized
.Ed
.Pp
Two additional types of double-emphasis are the strike-through and
highlight.
These are produced by pairs of tilde and equal characters, respectively:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~~Kirk~~Picard is the best ==captain==.
.Ed
.Pp
The highlight variant may be enabled in
.Xr lowdown 1
with highlight parsing enabled.
It's disabled by default because if used at the beginning of a line it
may be erroneously interpreted as a section.
.
.Ss Links
There are two types of links: inline and reference.
In both cases, the linked text is denoted by square brackets
.Pq Dq \&[] .
An inline link uses parentheses
.Pq Dq \&()
containing the URL immediately following the linked text in square
brackets to invoke the link.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[text to link](https://bsd.lv)
.Ed
.Pp
Local references may be absolute or relative paths:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[Picard](/Picard)
.Ed
.Pp
A reference link, on the other hand, keeps the URL outside of the text
\(em usually in the footnotes.
Define a reference link anywhere in a document by a title in square
brackets
.Pq Dq \&[]
followed a colon
.Pq Dq \&:
followed by the corresponding URL or path, then an optional title.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[link1]: https://www.bsd.lv/picard.jpg "Optional Title"
.Ed
.Pp
The title may be delimited with single quotes, double quotes, or
parenthesis.
It is only rendered in HTML output.
It encompasses all text until the last delimiter before the end of line,
so it may contain delimiters.
The title may be on its own line.
.Pp
Reference the link anywhere in your text using [text to the link] and
the same [link title], both in square brackets
.Pq Dq \&[]
next to each other:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Text about [Captain Picard][link1].
.Ed
.Pp
References need not follow the definition: both may appear anywhere in
relation to the other.
.Pp
Reference and inline links may be followed by PHP Extra attributes.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Lowdown [homepage][home] or
[github](https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown){ .gh #link1 }.

[home]: https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown { .home #link2 }
.Ed
.Pp
For inline links, the open brace must immediately follow the closing
parenthesis.
Attributes are separated by spaces.
.Pp
Values with a leading period
.Pq Qq \&.class
are interpreted as HTML (CSS) or OpenDocument classes, and values with
a leading pound symbol
.Pq Qq \&#id
are interpreted as in-document link identifiers.
.Pp
Nested links are disallowed by CommonMark and will result in unportable
behaviour if used.
.
.Ss Automatic Links
Automatic links are links to URLs or emails addresses that do not require text
to links; rather, the full link or email address is inferred from the
text.
To invoke an automatic link, surround the link or email address with
angle brackets
.Pq Dq \&<> ,
for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
<https://bsd.lv/>
<kristaps@localhost>
.Ed
.
.Ss Images
The image syntax resembles the links syntax.
The key difference is that images require an exclamation
mark
.Pq Dq \&!
before the text to link surrounded by square brackets
.Pq Dq \&[] .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
![Image text](imageurl.jpg)
.Ed
.Pp
Just like with links, there are both inline and reference image links.
.Pp
The inline style consists of an exclamation mark
.Pq Dq \&!
followed by the alternate text (which may be empty) surrounded by square
brackets
.Dq Pq \&[]
followed by the URL or the path in parentheses
.Dq Pq \&() .
.Pp
Unlike link text within square brackets, the alternate text is interpreted
as-is.
Thus, passing Markdown or HTML entities will be passed directly to output
(escaped according to output medium).
Alternate text
.Em may not
begin with the caret
.Pq Dq \&^
or percent
.Pq Dq \&% ,
else they will be interpreted as footnote or metadata references,
respectively.
.Pp
The parentheses may contain optional dimensions
.Pq Ar width Ns x Ns Op Ar height
starting with an equal sign or a quoted (single or double quotes) title
in any order after the URL or path.
These dimensions are pixel sizes.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
![Picard](https://bsd.lv/picard.jpg =250x250 'Engage!')
.Ed
.Pp
The reference style definition consists of an image identifier
surrounded by square brackets
.Dq Pq \&[]
followed by a colon
.Dq Pq \&:
followed by an image URL or path to image and optional title attribute
in double quotation marks.
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
[image1]: https://bsd.lv/picard.jpg "Picture of Picard"
.Ed
.Pp
Invoking the image reference is as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
A picture of the captain: ![Captain Picard][image1]
.Ed
.Pp
As with regular reference links, the definition and references may occur
anywhere in relation to each other.
.Pp
Images may also be followed by PHP Extra attributes for classes,
identifiers, and width and height.
Implementation of these depends on the output medium.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
![Picard](https://bsd.lv/picard.jpg){width=20% .class}
.Ed
.Pp
The open brace must immediately follow the closing parenthesis.
Attributes are separated by spaces.
.Pp
Value pairs
.Qq width=xx
and
.Qq height=xx
are interpreted as HTML (CSS), OpenOffice, or LaTeX dimensions.
These override set pixel dimensions.
Percentages are understood by all three media; otherwise, dimension
units are interpreted according to the medium.
.Pp
Values with a leading period
.Pq Qq \&.class
are interpreted as HTML (CSS) or OpenDocument classes, and values with a
leading pound symbol
.Pq Qq \&#id
are interpreted as in-document link identifiers.
.
.Ss Code
In addition to code blocks, inline code spans may be specified within
paragraphs or other block or inline elements.
To invoke a span of code, surround the code using backtick quotes
.Pq Dq \&` .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
I need your IP address to scp you Picard pics.
Use the `ifconfig iwm0` command.
.Ed
.Pp
To include literal backticks
.Pq Dq \&`
within a code span,
surround the code using multiple backticks
.Pq Dq \&(`` .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
``Here is a span of code with `backticks` inside it.``
.Ed
.Pp
If you have a literal backtick at the start or end of the span of code,
leave a space between the literal backtick and the delimiting backticks.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
`` `So many backticks.` ``
.Ed
.
.Ss Footnote Reference
Footnotes are a MMD extension of the basic syntax.
Footnote references point into a block-level
.Sx Footnote Definition .
They consist of the footnote name in square brackets, preceded by the
caret.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
P'tahk[^pt], tell me who you are, or I will kill you right here!
.Ed
.Pp
The footnote name is rendered as a number.
There may only be one footnote reference per definition.
If a footnote reference refers to an unknown definition, or if it has
already been used in referring to a definition, it is printed as-is.
Footnote definitions without references are not printed.
Nested footnotes are not allowed.
.
.Ss Superscripts
Uses the caret
.Pq Dq \(ha
to start a superscript, then another to end it.
Between these, white-space is not allowed.
This is the GFM style.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Though a great book, Q\(ha2\(ha isn't Star Trek canon.
.Ed
.Pp
If
.Qq short
.Pq traditional
style super-scripts are enabled, start with a caret, continuing to
white-space; or, if starting with an open parenthesis, continuing to the
close parenthesis with possible white-space.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Though a great book, Q\(ha2 isn't Star Trek canon.

.Ss HTML Content
While block-level HTML must begin with a recognised block-level HTML
element, span-level HTML need only begin and end with angle brackets,
and not contain a hyperlink.
.Pp
Thus,
.Li <p> ,
.Li <Leonard Nimoy> ,
and
.Li <span class="foo">
are all accepted.
Even malformed content, such as
.Li <span class="foo>
is accepted, so long as it begins and ends with angle brackets.
.
.Sh ESCAPES
.
.Ss Automatic Escapes
Output is automatically escaped depending upon the medium.
For example, HTML output will properly escape angle brackets
.Dq Pq \&<
and ampersands
.Dq Pq \&&
to produce conformant HTML.
The same goes with
.Xr man 7
output in escaping leading periods and so forth.
.
.Ss Backslash Escapes
Backslash escapes render literal characters that would otherwise invoke
a particular block or inline element.
For example, surrounding a phrase with single asterisks renders it as an
emphasis:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*Captain Picard*
.Ed
.Pp
However, if you want to invoke those italics as literal characters,
escape those asterisks using backslashes
.Pq Dq \e .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\e*Captain Picard\e*
.Ed
.Pp
The following characters may be escaped to produce literal text:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Li *
asterisk
.It Li \e
backslash
.It Li `
backtick
.It Li {
curly brace
.It Li \&!
exclamation mark
.It Li #
hash mark
.It Li -
minus sign
.It Li \&(
parentheses
.It Li \&.
period
.It Li +
plus sign
.It Li \&[
square bracket
.It Li _
underscore
.El

.Sh TYPOGRAPHY
.Xr lowdown 1
renders certain character sequences for easier reading.
This is called
.Qq smart formatting .
The following character sequences are converted to output-specific
glyphs.
The table shows whether the sequences must be on word boundaries.

.Pp
Word boundaries are defined by white-space (including the end of blocks,
such as paragraphs, or end of file) or punctuation.
Left word boundary refers to white-space or a left parenthesis or square
bracket to the left of the sequence.
Right refers to white-space or punctuation to the right.
.Pp
Smart quotes (single and double) are not context aware: using a left or
right quote depends upon the characters surrounding the quote, not
whether a prior quote mark has already been used.
