.Sh DESCRIPTION
Translate from
.Xr lowdown 5
into diverse output formats.
.Nm lowdown
formats documents,
.Nm lowdown Fl X Ar keyword
extracts metadata keywords, and
.Nm lowdown-diff
shows differences between documents as formatted output.
Results are written to standard output.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s
Standalone mode.
This emits a document envelope surrounding the output by drawing from
document metadata.
See
.Sx Metadata
on providing information to the document envelope.
This only applies to
.Fl T Ns Ar gemini ,
.Fl T Ns Ar html ,
.Fl T Ns Ar latex ,
.Fl T Ns Ar ms ,
and
.Fl T Ns Ar man .
.It Fl o Ar file
Send output to
.Ar file
unless it's
.Dq - ,
in which case fall back to the default of standard output.
.It Fl T Ar mode
The output mode.
This may be
.Ar html
for HTML5 output,
.Ar latex
for LaTeX,
.Ar gemini
for the Gemini format,
.Ar ms
for roff output using the classic (i.e., no-extension)
.Fl ms
package and needing table support,
.Ar term
for ANSI-compatible UTF-8 terminal output,
.Ar man
for roff output using the classic
.Fl man
package,
.Ar tree ,
to show the parse tree of the input document, and
.Ar null
to parse the document but do no rendering.
See
.Sx Output modes .
.It Fl X Ar keyword
Instead of converting the file, extract the given metadata keyword and
exit.
These will be escaped according to the output mode
.Fl T ;
for example, a title of
.Dq <foo>
with
.Fl T Ns Ar html
will be extracted as
.Dq &lt;foo&gt; .
Metadata is not rendered for
.Fl T Ns Ar tree
or
.Fl T Ns Ar null .
.It Ar oldfile
Input Markdown document used as the basis for comparison with
.Nm lowdown-diff .
.It Ar file
Input Markdown document.
If not given or if
.Ar file
is
.Dq - ,
read from standard input.
.El
.Pp
The following are options for input parsing.
These affect the parse tree passed to all outputs.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -parse-hilite
Enable highlight span support.
This are disabled by default because it may be erroneously interpreted
as section headers.
.It Fl -parse-math
Recognise mathematics equations.
.It Fl -parse-maxdepth=depth
The maximum depth of nested elements.
This defaults to 128, which is probably more than enough for any
real-world document.
If the maximum is hit, the system exits as if memory were exhausted.
Set to zero for no maximum.
.It Fl -parse-no-autolink
Do not parse
.Li http ,
.Li https ,
.Li ftp ,
.Li mailto ,
and relative links or link fragments.
.It Fl -parse-no-cmark
Do not parse with CommonMark constraints.
This also disables using the first ordered list value instead of
starting all lists at one.
.It Fl -parse-no-codeindent
Do not parse indented content as code blocks.
.It Fl -parse-no-deflists
Do not parse PHP extra definition lists.
.It Fl -parse-no-fenced
Do not parse GFM fenced (language-specific) code blocks.
.It Fl -parse-no-footnotes
Do not parse MMD footnotes.
.It Fl -parse-no-img-ext
Do not parse PHP extra image extended attributes.
.It Fl -parse-no-intraemph
Do not parse emphasis within words and links.
.It Fl -parse-no-metadata
Do not parse MMD metadata.
For the first paragraph to count as metadata, the first line must have
a colon in it.
Otherwise it's considered a regular paragraph.
Metadata is escaped according to the output mode.
.It Fl -parse-no-strike
Do not parse strikethroughs.
.It Fl -parse-no-super
Do not parse super-scripts.
.It Fl -parse-no-tables
Do not parse GFM tables.
.El
.Pp
There are many output options.
The following are shared by all output modes:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -out-standalone
Alias for
.Fl s .
.It Fl -out-no-smarty
Do not use the smart typography filter.
By default, certain character sequences are translated into
output-specific glyphs.
.El
.Pp
What follows are per-output options.
For HTML with
.Fl T Ns Ar html ,
these are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -html-hardwrap
Hard-wrap paragraph content by outputting line breaks where applicable.
.It Fl -html-no-escapehtml
If
.Fl -html-no-skiphtml
has been specified, this causes embedded HTML not to be escaped, and is
instead output verbatim.
This has no effect if
.Fl -html-no-skiphtml
has not been specified.
.It Fl -html-no-head-ids
Do not output
.Li id
attributes for headers.
.It Fl -html-no-num-ent
Don't normalise HTML entities (when possible) as numeric ones and
instead use the entities as given on input.
.It Fl -html-no-owasp
Don't follow the OWASP recommendations for escaping text, and do only
the minimal escaping to make sure that regular content isn't interpreted
as HTML.
.It Fl -html-no-skiphtml
Output embedded HTML.
By default, embedded HTML is not output at all.
See
.Fl -html-no-escapehtml .
.El
.Pp
For both
.Fl T Ns Ar man
and
.Fl T Ns Ar ms ,
the following apply:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -nroff-hardwrap
Hard-wrap paragraph content by outputting line breaks where applicable.
.It Fl -nroff-no-groff
Don't use
.Xr groff 1
style section headings and PDF hyperlinks.
If using
.Fl m Ns Ar spdf
with
.Xr groff 1 ,
these will be further rendered as a table of contents and clickable
links.
Only applies to
.Fl T Ns Ar ms .
.It Fl -nroff-no-numbered
Don't output numbered headings.
Only applies to
.Fl T Ns Ar ms .
.It Fl -nroff-no-skiphtml
Output embedded HTML.
This usually doesn't make sense because the HTML won't be interpreted by
the output reader.
By default, HTML is omitted.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl T Ns Ar term
output has the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -term-columns=columns
The number of columns in the screen.
Useful for when running in a pipe.
Defaults to what the terminal reports or 72 if in a pipe.
.It Fl -term-hmargin=margin
The number of left margin spaces.
Truncated to the number of columns.
Defaults to zero.
.It Fl -term-shortlinks
Shorten URLs to only the domain name and final path.
This is useful for reading when links aren't clickable.
Applies to images, autolinks, and real links.
.It Fl -term-vmargin=margin
The number of top and bottom margin newlines.
Defaults to zero.
.It Fl -term-width=width
Set the soft limit on the number of characters per line.
This may be exceeded by literal text.
The default (or if zero) is the number of terminal columns or 80 at
most.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl T Ns Ar gemini
output has several flags that control the placement of links.
By default, links (images, autolinks, and links) are queued when
specified in-line then emitted in a block sequence after the nearest
block element.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -gemini-link-end
Emit the queue of links at the end of the document instead of after the
nearest block element.
.It Fl -gemini-link-inline
Render all links within the flow of text.
This will cause breakage when nested links, such as images within links,
links in blockquotes, etc.
It should not be used unless in carefully crafted documents.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl T Ns Ar latex
output has the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -latex-no-numbered
Don't number sections (and subsections, etc.).
.It Fl -latex-no-skiphtml
Output embedded HTML.
This usually doesn't make sense because the HTML won't be interpreted by
the output reader.
By default, HTML is omitted.
.El
.Ss Metadata
If not disabled with
.Fl -parse-no-metadata ,
the following metadata keys are used when in standalone
.Pq Fl s
mode.
The metadata keys are canonicalised in lowercase and without spaces.

.Fl T Ns Ar man .
.It Li baseheaderlevel
The
.Qq top-most
header level.
For example, having a base header level of 2 will cause all headers

any instance of
.Li <h1>
would be instead
.Li <h2> .
If unset or less than one, defaults to one.

Images and equations not supported.
.It Fl T Ns Ar tree
Debugging output: not for general use.
.El
.Ss Diffing
If invoked as
.Nm lowdown-diff ,
the traditional Markdown output is augmented with features for viewing
file differences.
These depend upon the output mode.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T Ns Ar man , Fl T Ns Ar ms
When data has been removed, it is coloured red.
When data has been inserted, it is coloured in green.
In either case, your formatter must support colours or the texts will be
freely intermingled.

.El
.Pp
The algorithm used for diffing derives from
.Dq Detecting Changes in XML Documents
.Pq 2002 .
The algorithm for computing the shortest edit script between text nodes is
.Dq An O(NP) sequence comparison algorithm
.Pq 1990 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std lowdown lowdown-diff
.Pp
If the
.Fl X
flag is used,
.Nm lowdown
exits with an error if the given keyword is not found.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To view a Markdown file on an ANSI-compatible, UTF-8 terminal:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -Tterm foo.md | less -R
.Pp
If preferred, the terminal may also be used with
.Xr groff 1
or
.Xr mandoc 1
rendering:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -sTms foo.md | groff -tki -mspdf -Kutf8 -Tutf8 | less -R
lowdown -sTman foo.md | mandoc | less
.Ed
.Pp
To emit a standalone HTML5 document:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s foo.md > foo.html
.Pp
To use
.Xr groff 1
or
.Xr mandoc 1
to format as a PS file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -sTms foo.md | groff -tki -mspdf -Kutf8 > foo.ps
lowdown -sTman foo.md | mandoc -Tps > foo.ps
.Ed
.Pp
Or using a traditional
.Xr troff 1 ,
use the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown --nroff-no-groff -sTms foo.md | \e
  tbl | pic | troff -Tps -ms -mpdfmark > foo.ps
.Ed
.Pp
Both
.Xr groff 1
and
.Xr mandoc 1
support the
.Fl T Ns Ar pdf
arguments for PDF output.
The former also has
.Xr pdfroff 1 .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -sTms foo.md | \e
  groff -tki -mspdf -Kutf8 -Tpdf > foo.pdf
.Ed
.Pp
If the file has PS or EPS images and is being processed by
.Xr groff 1 ,
the images are not converted and the file needs to be manually converted
from PS.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -sTms foo.md | groff -tki -mspdf -Kutf8 > foo.ps
ps2dpdf foo.ps
.Ed
.Pp
UTF-8 support for PDF or PS is limited to
.Xr groff 1
installations with the appropriate fonts, such as the Unicode Times
font.
This and other Unicode fonts are not always installed by default.
They may be found, for PDF output, in the
.Pa devpdf
set of the
.Xr groff 1
font directory and are prefixed with
.Sq U .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -sTms foo.md | \e
  groff -Tpdf -tki -mspdf -Kutf8 -FU-T > foo.pdf
.Ed
.Pp
To extract the HTML-escaped title from a file's metadata:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -X title foo.md
