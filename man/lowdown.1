.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm lowdown
and
.Nm lowdown-diff
utilities translate from markdown into HTML5 in XML mode (the default)
or roff using the
.Fl ms
or
.Fl man
macro packages.
See
.Xr lowdown 5
for a reference of the accepted syntax.
If not given a
.Ar file ,
or if
.Ar file
is
.Dq - ,
.Nm
reads from standard input.
In
.Dq diff
mode, the
.Ar oldfile
must be provided.
The results in either case are written to standard output.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar feature
Disable the given
.Ar feature
.Pq see Sx Output features .
See
.Fl E .
You can specify this multiple times for different features.
.It Fl d Ar feature
Disable the given
.Ar feature
.Pq see Sx Input features .
See
.Fl e .
You can specify this multiple times for different features.
.It Fl E Ar feature
Enable the given
.Ar feature
.Pq see Sx Output features .
See
.Fl D .
You can specify this multiple times for different features.
.It Fl e Ar feature
Enable the given
.Ar feature
.Pq see Sx Input features .
See
.Fl d .
You can specify this multiple times for different features.
.It Fl o Ar file
Send output to
.Ar file
unless it's
.Dq - ,
in which case fall back to the default of standard output.
.It Fl s
Standalone mode.
This emits an HTML5 or roff document envelope surrounding the output.
See the
.Ar metadata
key of
.Sx Input features
on providing information to the document envelope.
.It Fl T Ar mode
The output mode.
This may be
.Ar html
for HTML5 output,
.Ar ms
for roff output using the classic (i.e., no-extension)
.Fl ms
package and needing table support, or
.Ar man
for roff ouput using the classic
.Fl man
package.
A debugging output mode,
.Ar tree ,
shows the parse tree of the input document.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Prints out warnings regarding Markdown syntax conformity and other
warnings.
.It Fl X Ar keyword
Instead of converting the file, extract the given metadata keyword and
exit.
These will be escaped according to the output mode
.Fl T ;
for example, a title of
.Dq <foo>
in
.Ar html
mode will be extracted as
.Dq &lt;foo&gt; .
In either
.Ar ms
or
.Ar man ,
a title of
.Dq .foo\ebar
will be
.Dq \e&.foo\eebar .
.El
.Pp
For best results, use the
.Fl T Ar html
output, as it includes graphics and equations.
The
.Ar ms
and
.Ar man
modes will elide graphics and equations.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
enables the
.Ar autolink ,
.Ar fenced ,
.Ar footnotes ,
.Ar metadata ,
.Ar strike ,
.Ar super ,
.Ar commonmark ,
and
.Ar tables
features.
You can see a full list of features in
.Sx Input features .
.Pp
The
.Ar html-skiphtml ,
.Ar html-head-ids ,
.Ar nroff-groff ,
.Ar nroff-skiphtml ,
and
.Ar smarty
output features are enabled by default.
See
.Sx Output features
for a full list.
.Ss Input features
There are a number of Markdown (and Markdown extension) features supported by
.Nm .
These can be enabled with
.Fl e
and disabled with
.Fl d .
They are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar autolink
Autolink
.Li http ,
.Li https ,
.Li ftp ,
.Li mailto ,
and relative links or link fragments.
.It Ar commonmark
Assume input conforms to the CommonMark specification.
In most cases, this is simply less laxist than the original Markdown.
This feature is
.Em experimental .
.It Ar fenced
Allow for GFM fenced (language-specific) code blocks.
.It Ar footnotes
MMD style footnotes.
This only supports one-liner footnotes on the same line as the footnote
definition (not the in-line referent).
.It Ar hilite
Highlight.
Do not use this option.
.It Ar math
Recognise single-dollar math mode.
.It Ar mathexp
Recognise double-dollar math mode.
This only works if
.Ar math
has also been enabled.
.It Ar metadata
Accept MMD metadata.
For the first paragraph to count as meta-data, the first line must have
a colon in it.
Otherwise it's considered a regular paragraph.
Meta-data is escaped according to the output mode; and if the
.Ar smarty
flag is set, also smartypantsed.
.It Ar nocodeind
Do not indent code blocks.
.It Ar nointem
Disable emphasis with links.
.It Ar strike
Strikethrough support.
.It Ar super
Allow for super-scripts.
This accepts foo^bar, which puts the parts following the caret until
whitespace in superscripts; or foo^(bar), which puts only the parts in
parenthesis.
.It Ar tables
Allow for GFM tables.
.El
.Pp
The parser also accepts link titles (quoted alongside the link address)
and image dimensions (=WxH or =Wx).
Both may also be specified, in any order.
For example,
.Li ![alt](url "title" =23x24) .
These are fairly standard Markdown extensions.
.Pp
If the
.Ar metadata
input feature is requested, the following metadata keys are used when in
standalone
.Pq Fl s
mode:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Li date
Document date in ISO-8601 YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD format.

Only used in
.Fl T Ar man
and
.Fl T Ar ms
mode.

Multiple CSS files (in order) may be separated by more than one space
(including newlines).
Only used in
.Fl T Ar html
mode.
.El
.Ss Output features
.Nm
allows for limited control over output features.
These can be enabled with
.Fl E
and disabled with
.Fl D .
They are as follows, prefixed by
.Dq html
or
.Dq nroff
depending upon the output mode:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar html-escape
Leaves in-line HTML in its source form as if it were opaque text.
.It Ar html-hardwrap
Retain line-breaks within paragraphs.
This option is retained for compatibility\(emdon't use it.
Instead, use proper escaping of newlines.
.It Ar html-skiphtml
Do not render in-document HTML at all.
Note that
.Ar html-escape
takes priority if both are specified.
Text within HTML elements remains.
.It Ar html-head-ids
Give each header an identifier created by encoding its content.
.It Ar nroff-numbered
Use numbered sections.
Only applies to the
.Fl T Ns Ar ms
output mode.
If this and
.Ar nroff-groff
are provided, the document outline will be exported.
.It Ar nroff-groff
Use GNU extensions (i.e., for
.Xr groff 1 )
when rendering output.
Only applies to the
.Fl T Ns Ar ms
output mode.
You'll need to include
.Fl m Ns Ar pdfmark
when invoking
.Xr groff 1
for formatting links,
.Fl t
for the table extension, and
.Fl m Ns Ar pspic
.Pq not necessary to specify
for images.
Note that
.Ar pspic
will only work with
.Fl T Ns Ar ps
output or via
.Xr pdfroff 1
as noted in the
.Sx EXAMPLES .
.It Ar nroff-hardwrap
Retain line-breaks within paragraphs.
.It Ar nroff-skiphtml
Do not render in-document HTML at all.
Text within HTML elements remains.
.It Ar smarty
Don't use
.Dq smartypants
formatting.
.Pq Applies to all output modes.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
To emit a standalone HTML5 document from a file
.Pa foo.md :
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s foo.md > foo.html
.Pp
To do the same but using
.Xr groff 1
to format as a PS file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -s -Tms foo.md | \e
  groff -t -mspdf -k -Kutf8 > foo.ps
.Ed
.Pp
The arguments to
.Xr groff 1
dictate input type
.Pq Fl m Ns Ar spdf ,
input encoding
.Pq Fl k , Fl K Ns Ar utf8 ,
and extensions
.Pq Fl t .
Note that
.Fl m Ns Ar spdf
is used instead of
.Fl m Ns Ar s
and
.Fl m Ns Ar pdfmark
to allow for the
.Dq XN
macro, which generates a table of contents for the output PS or PDF.
This macro is otherwise ignored.
.Pp
Alternatively, using only
.Xr mandoc 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -sTman foo.md | mandoc -Tps > foo.ps
.Ed
.Pp
To have PDF output, use the
.Xr pdfroff 1
utility instead of the
.Fl T Ns Ar pdf
output to
.Xr groff 1 ,
as it manages image conversion.
The
.Fl i
flag notes standard input; other flags are passed to
.Xr groff 1 .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -sTms foo.md | \e
  pdfroff -i -t -mspdf -k -Kutf8 > foo.pdf
.Ed
.Pp
To extract the HTML-escaped title from a file's metadata:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -X title foo.md
.Pp
Lastly, using a traditional
.Xr troff 1 ,
use the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lowdown -Dnroff-groff -sTms foo.md | \e
  tbl | troff -Tps -ms -mpdfmark > foo.ps
.Ed
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Pp
If the
.Fl X
flag is used,
.Nm
exits with an error if the given keyword is not found.
